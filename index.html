      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm a software developer currently improving my skills in the GW Coding Bootcamp during the summer of 2020.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm originally from New York.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love reading a good mystery/thriller, movies, the performing arts and, frankly, any form of creative expression.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is creatively contributing to the online presence of one of my favorite companies or cultural institutions.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Maryland but have a New York state of mind.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I am still chasing that 1980s rush I felt when hours pouring over BASIC code on my TI-99 console made Mr. Bojangles on my television screen.</p>
